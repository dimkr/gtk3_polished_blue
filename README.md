Polished-Blue GTK Theme
===========================

This is the fork of the [Flat-grey-rounded](https://github.com/dimkr/gtk3_flat_grey_rounded) theme, modified to look like the traditional [Polished-Blue Puppy Linux GTK 2 theme](https://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/pet_packages-noarch/gtk_theme_polished_blue-1.2.3.pet).
